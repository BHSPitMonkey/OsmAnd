# FIXME (Remove before merging)

Goals:

- [ ] In Profile > Configure map, under Routes, a new "Climbing routes" entry appears
- [ ] When enabled: Ways tagged `climbing=route` are rendered (somehow, distinctly from paths)
- [ ] When enabled: Nodes tagged `climbing=` `route_top` or `route_bottom` appear with small start/finish icons

Nice to have:

- [ ] In "Configure map", the new Climbing routes entry has a configuration page similar to "Hiking routes" and "Difficulty classification"
